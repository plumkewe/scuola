# HTML

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to create websites and web applications. It contains a set of tags and attributes which are used to structure and present content in a meaningful way. HTML is used to define the structure of a webpage, including its text, images, layout and links to other webpages. It is also used to create interactive elements, such as forms, and can be used to embed other multimedia elements, such as videos and audio. HTML is commonly used in combination with other web technologies, such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript to create robust and dynamic websites.
